* [Lexing and parsing mathematical expressions with F#](http://bugfree.dk/blog/2015/08/05/lexing-and-parsing-mathematical-expressions-with-fsharp)
* [Evaluating mathematical expressions using Shunting Yard and F#](http://bugfree.dk/blog/2015/08/14/evaluating-mathematical-expressions-using-shunting-yard-and-fsharp)
